# crazy-town

## Description
    
- My motivation to build this project was to test my knowledge of javascript, HTML, and CSS into one cohesive project.
- I built this project so others could test their coding  knowledge, save their scores, and see their improvements over time.
- By being able to test your knowledge and reflect back on previous scores, you can see your improvements!
- I learned so much that it is daunting to try and type it all. 
- I faced challenges around saving and parsing local data,  acessing the questions array properly, initializing the timer, etc. I faced challenges with almost every part of this assignment.
